- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @scriptax
- Iâ€™m interested in web developement on both sides of frontend and backend.
- It's been a short while since I started to learn programming. So basically Iâ€™m a rookie right now, learning HTML, CSS and JS by meself, part time. I'm also new to Github. So please don't freak out if you accidentally came across my repos!
- Iâ€™m building very small web apps on my free time which I push here once in a while. I hope I get to free up more time for this. Code on!
