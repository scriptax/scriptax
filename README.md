# Hi ðŸ‘‹, 
## This is scriptax
Constantly trying to learn web developement on both sides of frontend and backend.
I'm learning frontend technologies these days, Especially React.js. I'm also building a couple of small projects right now. Looking forward to spending more time on programming, here on Github. It's like a goldmine here!

### Frontend technologies I'm learning/working on
